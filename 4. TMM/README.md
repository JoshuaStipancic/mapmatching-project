# Introduction to Topological Map Matching

## Algorithm Description
This algorithm provides map matching using a topological method. This algorithm is an implementation of the *TrackMatching* service by Fabrice Marchal (https://mapmatching.3scale.net/). *TrackMatching* uses a topological decision rule-based methodology that detects and solves spatial mismatches as GPS measurements are collected.

# Run the Topological Map Matching Algorithm
1. Create a TrackMatching account (https://mapmatching.3scale.net/signup) to generate a unique application ID and application key.
2. Enter the application ID and application key in the first rows of the main algorithm script located at *Code/RunTMM.sh*.
3. Run the main algorithm file, *Code/RunTMM.sh*.
4. Results are stored in the folder *Results/*.

# Licensing
*TrackMatching* is provided as a SaaS (Software as a Service) running on the Amazon cloud platform.
