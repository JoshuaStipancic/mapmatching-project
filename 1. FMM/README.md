# Introduction to Fuzzy Map Matching

## Algorithm Description
This algorithm provides map matching using a fuzzy logic map matching method. This algorithm adopts a modified version of *FuzzyMM Algorithm* created by Nikolai Gorte at the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of MÃ¼nster (https://github.com/ngort01/fuzzyMM).
 
The advanced map matching procedure is comprised of three main algorithms:
* Initial MapMatching Process (IMP)
* Subsequent MapMatching Process along a link (SMP-1)
* Subsequent MapMatching Process at a junction (SMP-2)
