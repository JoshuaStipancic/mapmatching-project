#Introduction to Advanced Map Matching

##Algorithm Description
Map Matching using a Fuzzy Logic Based Map Matching Algorithm

This code is a modified version of "FuzzyMM Algorithm" created by Nikolai Gorte in institute for geoinformatics 
university of m√ºnster  https://github.com/ngort01/fuzzyMM
 
Three main algorithm in this code are as follows:
- Initial MapMatching Process (IMP)
- Subsequent MapMatching Process along a link (SMP-1)
- Subsequent MapMatching Process at a junction (SMP-2)

##Publications
A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in: Quddus, Mohammed A. 2006 (January).

#Run the Advanced Map Matching Algorithm
After run the 'Main' file, the packages will be installed properly.

A simple example is carried out to show the performance of the algorithm, please look at the 'Test' folder.
