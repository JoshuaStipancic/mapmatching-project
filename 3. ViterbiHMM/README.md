#Introduction to Probabilistic Map Matching (Viterbi)

##Algorithm Description
https://github.com/mapillary/map_matching

`map_matching` is a Python library that associates a sequence of
locations (e.g. GPS trajectory) to the underlying road network. The
matching considers both road network topology and spatial
relations. The library provides a simple interface for use, and above
that it is also intended to work nicely with PostGIS and OSM road
network to build real-world applications.
