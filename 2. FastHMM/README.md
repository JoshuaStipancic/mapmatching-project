# Introduction to Probabilistic Map Matching (Fast)

## Algorithm Description
Map Matching using a "Fast Hidden Markov Model" (FHMM) Algorithm

This code is a modified version of "GraphHopper" created by Peter Karich.

Five main algorithms in this code are as follows:
- Dijestra
- Bidirectional Dijestra
- A*
- Bidirectional A*
- Alternative routing

You can find the main source: https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper
https://github.com/graphhopper/map-matching/
It is a fast and memory efficient Java routing engine, released under Apache.
It is uses Open Street Map and GTFS data. 

## Publications
The algorithms are used in this package designed by Hannes Koller in "Fast Hidden Markov Model MapMatching for Spare and Noisy Trajectories" published in 2015.

# Run the Probabilistic Map Matching (Fast) Algorithm
 After installing "Grapphaer" and handdle it with "Appache" and "Maven" in Java, you can use the java file in "Code" folder.
You can consider the GPS data in Data_GPXformat folder and the related results in "Results _All" folder as examples.
