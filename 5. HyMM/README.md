#Introduction to Hybrid Map Matching

##Algorithm Description

This section presents a hybrid topological- HMM map matching method that detects and solves mismatches GPS measurements are collected.
This method is used in Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) and you can find the main source in https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend.
